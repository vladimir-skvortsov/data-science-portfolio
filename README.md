## Titanic

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

## Job Placement

Due to the growing need of educated and talented individuals, especially in developing countries, recruiting fresh graduates is a routine practice for organizations. Conventional recruiting methods and selection processes can be prone to errors and in order to optimize the whole process, some innovative methods are needed.
